Howdy! We are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 2/17/23.


We have started integration and are working on the physical piece movement. After discussing with Max during Wednesday lab, we have 
decided to change the dimensions of the chess board to have a 30"x30" playing field. This includes the 64 chess squares as well as 36 
graveyard squares. 

Grayson - I have begun soldering the PCB and plan to have it done by next lab in order to start testing it. I was able to finish the motor 
path finding code and am now ready to combine it with Mo's coordinate system code and test our codes together. This weekend, I will be
rebuilding the chess board to have the bigger dimensions as agreed on. 

Mo - I have finished the coordinate system code, I am now waiting for the new chess board to be built so that we can measure the center 
coordniates of each square in steps to then fill into the array. Once that is done, I'll be able to combine it with Grayson's code and then
we can start testing it with the motors/magnet. This weekend, I plan to start testing different methods to color our dark squares on the 
chess board while maintaining transparency for the camera. 

Swade - I recieved the new cameras and was able to test them during lab. The wide angled camera will need 22" in height, and the fish eyed
camera needs only 12" in height. The plan for now is to proceed with the fish eyed camera and attach a filter that takes away the
distortion. I've also started looking into different ways to attach the symbols to the bottom of each piece. 

Dan - This past week I helped Mo and Grayson with the motor movement code and started integrating it with the web app. I also helped Swade
test the new cameras and used a filter to get rid of the distortion  from the fish eyed lense.
