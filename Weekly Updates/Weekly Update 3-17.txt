Howdy we are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 3/10/2023 and 3/17/2023.

Since the last update, we've integrated all of the code onto two main scripts for gaemplay and are currently working on debugging and testing those. Once done, we'll call them with a startup script so that we can run the game headlessly. We finalized the height needed for the camera and have adjusted the physical board accordingly. We have also stained the board and added legs to it as well. After replacing the IC chip, the boost converter now outputs 12V successfully but the MOSFET switch for the magnet is not working as desired yet. We have tested the boost converter with the motors and have successfully been able to power them and run piece movements successfully. We have tested the pathfinding code integaration with the raspberry pi's motor control and coordinate array codes (all on the same Master Script) and have successfully moved pieces to the right locations with it. We are still fixing some issues with the bluetooth sending moves from the web app to the pi as well as finishing up the camera to web app script. This week will we find a remedy for the magnet switch and also begin mounting all the components to the physical board. Also, this upcoming weekend we plan on coloring the plexiglass with dye (maroon for black squares, clear for white).
