Howdy, we are Group 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 2/3/23.

Grayson: After discussing my completed PCB designs for both the Motor Boost Converter and the Electromagnet Boost Converter 
with Max on Monday, we decided it would be better to design the PCB so that only one Boost Converter is needed. So I spent most of the week
redesinging my PCB to have only one Boost Converter that has an output branch going stright to the motors and a second output branch that
feeds into a MOSFET that acts like a switch to turn the Electromagnet on/off. I am still waiting for the Plexiglass and limit switches to
be delivered.

Dan: I worked on making the UI for the web app run smoother and also was able to add game ID's.

Swade: I placed an order for a new pi camera that advertises 120 degree wide angle lense, so that should work better than the cameras we've
ordered in the past. Once that comes in, we can begin integrating the piece identification software to the web app.

Mo: Measurements and coding of both the interior and outer array have taken place. A grid/coordinate system for the squares is now in
development and can be completed once the Plexiglass comes in.

All: As soon as the camera and Plexiglass get delivered, we can start integrating all the subsystems (minus the PCB). Good news is that
we can run the motors and electromagnet without the PCB by using a 12V power supply, so we don't need to wait on the PCB to come in before 
starting integration.
