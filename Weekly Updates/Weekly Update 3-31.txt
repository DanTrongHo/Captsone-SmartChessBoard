Howdy we are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 3/31.

Since the last update, I worked with Max about PCB validation and have collected the data for it as advised, I just now need to put the data on graphs for next week's final presentation. Max and Professor Lusher have already been informed about our Pi SD card issue, but that has now been fixed and a new SD card has been made with everything downloaded successfully. For the plexiglass situation, we have placed an order for a new sheet but in the meantime we purchased a temporary sheet from Lowe's in order to place on top and test the camera this week (until the new sheet comes in). The temporary sheet is not the correct thickness, but is transparent so it'll work for the camera testing but not for any magnet use. We have also received the film to put on for dark squares and after initial testing, it should work fine. We'll test more in lab today and this week. The main focus now is to test the camera and get it working. Once we know the piece identification is good, we will then be able finalize the pixel coordinates and the step coordinates for the board and then wrap up the main script and test it.
