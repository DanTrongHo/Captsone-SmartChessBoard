Howdy, we are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly project update for 3/24.

Since the last update, Grayson was able to get his PCB to work and has suscessfully run the motors and electromaqgnet through it. We have wired everything together and are now ready to mount all the components to the bottom layer of plywood permanantly, just waiting on some screws to come in. We have attempted to dye the board, however it did not go as planned and dried darker than desired. We have decided to go in a different direction with the cloring of the board; we ordered some transparent colored film stickers to place on instead. Once those come in, we'll apply them to the board. We are fully integrated onto our main script at this point and are just fixing different bugs/errors that have popped up. The first fix we are working on is a bluetooth connection error that has been giving Dan problems when communicating between web app and raspberry pi. Another fix we are working on is that once we color the squares and attach the new plexilgass on, we'll have to adjust the coordinates of each square in our library for both the motor control and the image processing. We are also finishing up adding the shapes to all the pices, our sticker paper finally came in and we can print off our symbols and get those attatched.
