*Meant to upload this on Friday*

Our main focus for this past week was to finish up the 5V to 12V Boost converter PCB's, pick out a new camera, and get our subsystems back up to where we left off in 403. 
The PCB's are almost complete, and the plan is to get Dr. Lusher to take one last look at them Monday morning in office hours and then order them.
We have selected a camera to be ordered with the PCB's on Monday (1/30). 
In lab, we were able to get everything back to working order (as it was at the end of 403).

Our goals for next week are to select Limit switches for the electromagnet, place the part order on Monday, and add the completed Altium files to Github Monday morning.    
We also plan to start integration by beginning to write the software for the physical piece movement.
