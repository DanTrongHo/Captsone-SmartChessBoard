Howdy, we are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 4/7.


Since the last update, we have found a better method for detecting the shapes needed for piece identification. As shown in lab last Wednesday, we found a way to use RGB values to block out everything that's not a chess piece symbol in order to make it easier for our piece identification to run without picking up random shapes on the ceiling if the FEDC. We have ran it successfully with really large shapes and it identified the 6 test pieces correctly. Now that we know it can work, we are working on decreasing the size of the shapes to fit better on the pieces. It's now just a process of finding the smallest size that can still be identified correctly. We have received the new plexiglass and have attached it to the board. We'll draw the squares on in lab this week and then calibrate the step and pixel coordinates. The last piece of the puzzle we are still working on is getting the bluetooth to work with multiple sequential moves. Right now, we have it running two functions in parallel which should be updating the descriptor with move information. However, when sent to the website, the website receioves the info as empty.
