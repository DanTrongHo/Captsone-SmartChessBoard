Howdy! We are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 2/10/23.

Grayson: This past week, I finished the PCB design for the Boost Converter and sent it to be ordered on Tuesday, 2/7. I also began writing 
a pathfinding program to help the motors travel the seams of the squares to deliver the pieces. During lab, we realized that the current
chess board dimensions were too small to include a graveyard, so after a few discussions we decided it would be best to go ahead and
correct the error by rebuilding the chess board to have the proper dimensions. Since the physical chess board is my subsystem, I plan to
fix it during this next weekend (2/18 & 2/19) once the new timing belts arrive from Amazon.

Dan: I am currently working on integrating piece movement with the web app with Mo and Grayson. Once the new camera arrives, integration 
with piece identification can start. 

Swade: Waiting on new camera to be delivered, it's supposed to come by Monday 2/13. Once delivered I will test it and figure out the height
needed for the chess board to determine if we need to make in into a table or keep it as is. During the week, I helped think through the
process of piece promotion and how the camera will be used to help track the physical player's promotions. 

Mo: Over the past week I have been working on writing the python script for the piece movement. The array being used to house the 
coordniates of each piece is complete, just need to figure out the actual x and y step coordinates for each square once the chess board is 
fixed. I have also started testing out different methods to stain the plexiglass to incorporate light and dark squares.
