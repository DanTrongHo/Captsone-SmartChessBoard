Howdy, we are Team 50 - Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 4/14.

Since the last update, we have decided to move forward with the larger shapes for our piece identification. After running some tests, we have confidence in the accuracy of the piece identification now and are ready to begin testing it with actual gameplay. We tested the big shapes in a living room to simulate normal oiperating conditions for our chess board, and we found sucess with our software recognizing the pieces accurately. We are having some trouble when there is an overhead light that causes a glare on the plexiglass, but we have been able to somehwat mitigate those errors by having an led strip shine from the bottom of the board to illuminate the shapes on the pieces. The highest accuracy we've achieved has been when there is no direct light over the chess board, our inital tests showed >95% accuracy to pieces not affected by glare. We now just need to run multiple tests in a row to validate our findings with the piece identification. Also, we have just about completed the script for the physical player's move, and therefore were ready to start testing sequential moves and then real gameplay. We just need to permanently attach the shapes to the pieces now as well as decorate the plexiglass board to indicate light/dark squares. We have also implemented a button for a chess timer, but are still working on implementing the timer on the web app. We have also added an LED indicator for when the physical player makes an invalid move, and if time permits, we will try to program the board to move the physical player's piece back. Once we test the physical player's move and then test sequential moves, we will be ready to tidy up the mian startup script and run full gameplay tests.
