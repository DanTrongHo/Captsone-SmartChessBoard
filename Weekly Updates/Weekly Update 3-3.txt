Howdy we are Team 50: Smart Chess Board and this is our weekly update for 3/3/2023.


This past week we have continued working together to integrate the subsyetms. We have tested the new chess board and the motors move as exepected. Dan, Mo, and Grayson finally got the coordinates for each playing sqaure and can now combine their codes/functions together on one script to be fully integrated. Dan and Swade have continued to test the fish eyed lense with the de-fisheye filter. They are now determining the final height needed for between the plexiglass and camera. They have confirmed what symbol sizes work for the pieces, but are still working on getting pixel coordinates for each square to determine what piece is where to send to the web app. Grayson is still working on testing the 5V-12V Boost Converter PCB and figuring out why the output is only 5V (instead of 12V). We have found a boost converter on Amazon as a potential backup plan, but the current plan is to find the probelm on the PCB and fix it. Grayson also finished soldering on longer wires for the motors and magnet so that over spring break everything can be wired up and mounted to the chess board as the final parts of the chess board are added (legs, colored squares, stain, etc.).
